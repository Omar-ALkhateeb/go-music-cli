# go-music-cli

simple CLI that downloads YouTube playlists while ignoring mainstream artists (top 500 on MTV)
run main.go and enter the playlist's url (should be in the format of https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcdC82KfUxY6V7YOcwJQ-ZsdUorPC6Ine)

### TODO

- make an option for download path
